January '16: This is a copy of the most recent
version of gazebo::physics::JointController from bitbucket.
It is meant to replace the old
implementation in Gazebo 2.2 (and maybe later ones too) such that it
is compatible with Gazebo 5.0.1 versions and higher. 
this class is only used locally as a helper. Eventually when
older Gazebo versions are not supported any more, this class will be
removed from this package.
