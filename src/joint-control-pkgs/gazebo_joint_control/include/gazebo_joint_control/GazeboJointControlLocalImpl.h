/**
 * \brief Implementation of GazeboJointControl which bypasses gazebo::physics::JointController::Update() call to
 * address limitations described in the base class.
 *
 * 1. This class can maintain position and velocity controllers at the same time.
 *    Which means, it accepts both velocity and position commands. It is even possible to send a mix of velocity and
 *    position commands for all the joints.
 *
 * 2. The control of the joints may also happen via gazebo::physics::Joint::SetVelocity() instead of
 *    gazebo::physics::Joint::SetForce(). This may be useful for some Gazebo versions which don't work well
 *    with SetForce(). To use Joint::SetVelocity() instead of Joint::SetForce(), set the ROS parameter
 *    /gazebo_use_set_velocity. Note that this requires loading different PID values via the ROS parameters as well.
 *
 * **To 1.)**
 *
 * Joints will be updated either by
 *
 * 1. force or
 * 2. velocity
 * 3. position
 *
 * in the given order of priority!
 * Specifying higher-priority values will overwrite lower-priority values.
 * For example, if both position and velocity commmands are specified for the same joint,
 * the velocity will overwrite the position command. There is only one exception to this:
 * If the velocity is 0, it will *not* overwrite the position command, because the
 * position command will then be required (see also documentation of base class!).
 *
 * **To 2.)**
 *
 * It is still on the TODO list to support the use of gazebo::physics::SetForce() instead of setting the
 * velocity. This should be relatively easy, but it will most likely also require other PID values.
 *
 * **Requirements**
 *
 * This class requires ROS parameters as in the example template file config/ControlTemplate.yaml
 * to be loaded on the parameter server. This is to read in the PID values which are specific to controlling the
 * joints.
 *
 * **Limitations**
 *
 *  At the moment, no force commands are implemented yet.
